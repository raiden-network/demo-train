# Summary

Update 23/7/2017: An update on the case that support camera and GPIO is here. Try it if you have problem to print the hinge of the original version.

Update 14/3/2017: It is quite sad to receiving some of your comments reporting parts fused together, but at the same time some other telling me they have no problem at all. I believe it all depends on how well your printer handle hanging and small gaps. The geometry of the hinge is really compact. Otherwise it will not go well with the baby Pi Zero and Pi Zero W. 
Good news for those who had tried with problem. I added a "v2" version for the low profile case. I added extra clearance to the hinge geometry. Hopefully it would avoid parts fusing together when print with bigger nozzle size. If it works for your please post a make picture back to here. I really want to see if it works (or not). Thanks.
 
Update 13/2/2017: I received comments suggested me to separate to model to 2 parts since the top and bottom fused together as it print. I have no idea if one can really assemble it if you print them separately, but I did it anyway and let you guys to have a try.  Let me knows if it helps.
 
Update 2: The GPIO version is here. To fix the Pi Zero you'll need 4 x M2.6 screws that are 15mm long.

Update: The camera version is here! It hold both your Pi Zero and Camera together in a small box. It comes in 2 sub-versions. First one doesn't use any screw, but you may need some extra help to secure the Pi Zero in the position it suppose to be. In my case I use 2 rubber bands. The second one use 4 x M2.6 screws which are 12mm long.

My first Raspberry Pi Zero case. Support the new version that comes with a camera port. It can be printed in one piece and no assembly is required. This is a low profile version, which means it will only hold the PI Zero itself without any jumper and HAT on it. I'll publish more version later. So do follow this creation if you need bigger versions that can hold the GPIO jumpers, camera or even HAT.
